            <h3 class="heading">The type of personal information we collect</h3></p>
            <p>We currently collect and process the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>When you sign up we collect your email address which is used to identify your login.</p></li>
                <li><p>When you install our app to a Slack workspace, we record your <strong>Slack workspace id</strong>
                    and an encrypted access token supplied to us by Slack in order to be able to respond to bot commands.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>When you invite a bot to a channel we: collect that <strong>Slack channel id</strong>,</p></li>
                <li><p>Record the <strong>association between our reference and a user’s slack id</strong>,</p></li>

            <h3 class="heading">How we get the personal information and why we have it</h3>
            <p>Most of the personal information we process is provided to us directly by you for one of the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>
                    The blockchain alert service essentially requires the collection of our customers' Slack workspace name, channel id and user id for the service to run</p></li>
                <li><p>
                    We also collect the command history sent to the bot providing the alert service to provide support services when functionality fails and to additionally, understand the use of the service to improve it in future. For example, knowing the frequency of command use, whether the system is used constantly or periodically, can suggest new commands and where effort should be put to improve system speed.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>We use the information that you have given us in order to conduct user research about product improvement, e.g., to gain insight or support for new functionality.</p>
